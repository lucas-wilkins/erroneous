# erroneous
A python tool for managing the propagation of errors 

The Problem
===========

The problem *erroneous* solves is best illustrated by a problem that occurs with 
the standard approach to propagating errors, which is to calculate a new variance
whenever you perform a calculation.

Consider two variables, $a$ and $b$ with variances $\var a$ and $\var b$.

Add these together to get $x = a+b$ and the calculated variance using the
standard error propagation rules will be $\var a + \var b$
